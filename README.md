### How to use HTADevTools
  1. Create a new .hta application
  2. Add <link> and <script> tags to the <head> of your applications pointing to the respective HTADevTools files
  3. Add the element in htadevtools.html into  your body
  
### Who is this for?
  
  1. Developers looking to move away from VBScript and have a semi-reasonable debugging process.
  2. Developers under a tight set of limitations for solution creation, with .hta being the only solution.
  3. People looking to reinvent the wheel.
